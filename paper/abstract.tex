Lossy image compression is essential for efficient transmission and storage. Most widely used methods, such as JPEG, use transforms like the discrete cosine transform (DCT) that map image data into a continuous domain, which necessitates carefully designed quantization techniques. Another promising approach relies on low-rank approximation methods, such as singular value decomposition (SVD). While current methods within this approach also require a quantization layer, their compression performance is unfortunately suboptimal due to higher sensitivity to quantization errors than JPEG. Therefore, we introduce a variant of integer matrix factorization (IMF) that forms the basis for our quantization-free lossy image compression technique. IMF provides a low-rank representation of the image data as a product of two smaller factor matrices with bounded integer elements, thereby eliminating the need for quantization. Moreover, the reshaped factor matrices can be treated as grayscale images, allowing any lossless image compression standard to be seamlessly integrated into the proposed IMF framework. We propose an efficient, provably convergent iterative algorithm for IMF using a block coordinate descent (BCD) scheme, where each column of a factor matrix is updated one at a time using a closed-form solution. The experiments show that our IMF method outperforms JPEG, achieving improvements of over 4 dB and 7 dB in PSNR at 0.15 bits per pixel (bpp) on the Kodak and CLIC datasets, respectively. We also assessed the ability of the methods to preserve visual semantic information by evaluating an ImageNet pre-trained classifier on compressed images. Notably, the IMF method yielded over a 20\% relative improvement in top-1 accuracy over JPEG at bit rates under 0.25 bpp.
